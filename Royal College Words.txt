Objectives of Training in the Specialty of

Internal Medicine




2011

VERSION 1.0

This document applies to those who begin training on or after July 1st, 2011. (Please see also the “Policies and Procedures.”)

DEFINITION

An Internist is a specialist trained in the diagnosis and treatment of a broad range of diseases in adults involving all organ systems, and is proficient in the medical management of patients who have undifferentiated or multi-system disease processes. An Internist cares for hospitalized and ambulatory patients and may play a role in teaching or research.


GOALS

Upon completion of training, a resident will be a competent specialist in Internal Medicine and will be able to fulfill a consultant’s role in the specialty. The resident must acquire proficiency in the theoretical basis of the specialty, including its foundations in basic medical sciences and research. The overall aim of this physician training is to instill knowledge and understanding, skills and attitudes, from which are formed the competencies for lifetime practice as a physician in adult Internal Medicine.

Residents must demonstrate the requisite knowledge, skills, and attitudes for effective patient-centered care and service to a diverse population. In all aspects of specialist practice, the graduate must be able to address issues of gender, sexual orientation, age, culture, ethnicity and ethics in a professional manner.

These Objectives of Training have three purposes:

•	To provide a template for trainees in acquiring relevant knowledge, skills and attitudes in Internal Medicine
•	To provide guidance for programs regarding required areas of training

•	To provide a template for assessment of trainees
